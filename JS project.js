/*Allow frame rate to go past monitor refresh rate - with the underlying requestAnimationFrame you are locked into whatever frame rate the browser gives you 
(this is usually no higher than the monitor refresh rate, but it can be higher).
I can take control of the loop myself with the following using the redraw function. However the browser may not visualise the canvas any quicker than the 
requestAnimationFrame frequency even though it is simulated. This can result in what looks like stuttering.

requestAnimationFrame is a broswer API method:

The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser 
calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. 
The method takes a callback as an argument to be invoked before the repaint. You should call this method 
whenever you're ready to update your animation onscreen. This will request that your animation function be called before the browser performs the next repaint. 
The number of callbacks is usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers.
requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background tabs to improve performance and battery life.*/
